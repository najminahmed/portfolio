    <h1>About</h1>
    <div id="content_p">
    <p>New York is hands down the most amazing place to be. The food, the culture, the sort of snobby people combined with the city lights makes it everything
      it seems to be. Like straight out of the movies. <br> <br>
   While I was there, I got to see Times Square past midnight with there somehow being so many people there. We also took a ferry to see Ellis Island and stop at
      Liberty Island to see what New York is most known for. The Statue did not disappoint and it was nice seeing it and being reminded of the history behind it.
      We weren't able to enter the Statue since it was going through construction so I'm hoping to go back one day.</p>
