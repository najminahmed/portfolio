    <p>Hi, I'm Najmin! One of my favorite parts about life is being able to travel with my family. There is nothing better than planning a trip and being able to 
    see how people from different places interact and live. My family and I don't have much, but my dad has always made sure that we're able to have special memories
    in different parts of the world. We've mainly traveled in the U.S. as a family, with road trips being our main way of travel but graduated to air travel just last year.
    That's also when I discovered that I get very sick on an airplane. Not fun at all. <br> <br>
    In this website, I will be showcasing my three favorite travels and some fun stories to go along with them. Traveling means a lot to me and has helped me try new things
      I never would have thought I'd have the chance to experience. It's an extremely important part on my bucket list and I am excited to share that with all of you.</p>
