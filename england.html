    <h1>When in England</h1>
    <div id="content_p">
    <p>This trip was SUPER exciting for me since my family from all different states of America came to England to attend my cousin's wedding. I was reunited with 
      family I hadn't seen in ages and also met some family for the first time. It's crazy to think that the United Kingdom is about the same size as Michigan.
      While we were there, we were able to road trip throughout the country and see some fantastic sights. The only disappointment I have is that I was not able to
      have fish and chips while I was there. What a bummer.<br> <br>
    The highlights of that trip would include sightseeing around London, going to Alton Towers, and sneaking away from my family to walk to Nandos. The hype about Nandos
      is no joke; it is hands down one of the best restaurants I've ever been to. In London, we spent the entire day walking around and catching the 'tube.' I can't believe
      I was 443 feet up in the air in the London Eye; it was one of the scariest but beautiful moments of my life. We were able to catch a boat on the river and go underneath
      the London Bridge and the Tower Bridge. For Alton Towers, we took about a two hour road trip from London to Staffordshire to attend this awesome theme park. 
      But, it's safe to say that it doesn't compare to America's rollercoasters.</p>
